    <h2>Bay Area Bike Share - Data Challenge</h2>

    <p>There are four different modes available.  By default, you're looking at Current Availability.  This is up to the minute bicycle data from the bike share system itself.</p>
    <p>The other modes are historical and will run queries within the bike share data set.  You can see the Popular Trips or the stations most likely to be Full and Empty.  You can also narrow those searches down by time of day and day of week.</p>
    <p>For Popular Trips you can focus on casual users or see what subscribers are up to.</p>
    <p>Lastly, you can jump between locations including San Francisco, San Jose, and others.</p>
