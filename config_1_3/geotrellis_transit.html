    <h2>GeoTrellis Travel Shed Example</h2>

    <p>This visualization example interfaces to the GeoTrellis Transit project.  We're looking at a Travelshed for Philadelphia, showing us how far we could get from the center of the area in 50 minutes.  Various modes of transport, such as biking or walking, and subways or regional rail are available.  We can see how using those various modes would change the travelshed.</p>
