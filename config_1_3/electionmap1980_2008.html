    <h2>Presidential Election Data by County 1980-2008</h2>

	<p>This data set is based on  Census election data covering the years 1980 to 2008 indexed by county.</p>
	<p>The color for each county is calculated by interpolating between red (republican), green(independent), and blue(democrat).  The resulting color expresses these percentages visually.  Thanks go to Bob Vanderbei for the approach.</p>
