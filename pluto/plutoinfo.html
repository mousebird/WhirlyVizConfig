    <h2>PLUTO Data</h2>

	<p>The Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) data set shows tax lot information, with boundaries, for all five boroughs of New York.  In this presentation we're tying color to height; Redder is taller.  Selecting a lot will show you the address, who (or what) is the owner and the number of floors.</p>
